# Market-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Crypto-Trading-Dashboard-Insights
Project Overview:
This project analyzes how market sentiment influences trading behavior, profitability, and risk in the cryptocurrency market. Using real trading data, the project segments trades into regimes such as “Extreme Fear”, “Fear”, “Neutral”, “Greed”, and “Extreme Greed”, and compares key performance and risk metrics across these groups.
Key analytics and visualizations are created using Python and Power BI.

Key Objectives:
Explore the relationship between market sentiment and trade profitability (PnL)
Quantify risk exposure (fees, leverage, trade size) under different sentiment conditions
Visualize trading volume and behavioral activity segmented by sentiment
Draw actionable conclusions about risk and performance for crypto traders

Data & Tools:
Dataset: Cryptocurrency trading data with sentiment classification, PnL, size, volume, fees, leverage, and timestamp
Technologies: Python (pandas, seaborn/matplotlib for EDA and box plots), Power BI (interactive dashboards, bar/column charts, tables)
Visuals: Average trade size, PnL by sentiment, trading fees, volume, leverage, and risk tables

Main Findings:
Trade sizes, volumes, and average leverage peak in "Fear" and "Greed" periods, suggesting high activity and risk-taking during emotional markets.
“Extreme” sentiment regimes result in both the highest profits and largest losses, highlighting volatility and risk.
Average fees and leverage are higher in aggressive regimes, but neutral sentiment shows more conservative, but often less profitable, trading activity.
Distinct patterns in risk and reward emerge based on market mood, supporting data-driven trading strategies and risk management.
